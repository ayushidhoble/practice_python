'''
Define a function generate_n_chars()that takes
an integer n and a character c and returns a string,
n characters long, consisting only of c:s. For
example, generate_n_chars(5,"x")should return
the string "xxxxx". (Python is unusual
in that you can actually write an expression
5 * "x"that will evaluate to
"xxxxx". For the sake of the exercise you should
ignore that the problem can
be solved in this manner.)

    a = ""
    for i in range(n):
        a += s
    return a

print(generate_n_chars(5,"x"))
